Description: Implements e-value and e-process methodology for interim monitoring
    of adaptive clinical trials. Provides betting-martingale e-process construction
    for two-arm binary trials, safe logrank tests for survival endpoints,
    always-valid confidence sequences, futility monitoring, design calibration
    (GROW optimal betting fractions, expected stopping times), and simulation tools
    for comparing e-value monitoring with group sequential and Bayesian approaches.
    Integrates with the established R clinical trials ecosystem (gsDesign, rpact,
    survival). Based on the methodology described in Sokolova and Sokolov (2026),
    "E-values for Adaptive Clinical Trials."
